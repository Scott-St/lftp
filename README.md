# lftp Readme
This Docker will mirror from your seedbox to local unraid server.  After mirroring is complete it will delete the source files and it will extract and *.RAR files in the folder root.

ie.  
If the unraid download directory is /mnt/cache/Downloads/
It will extract all files from /mnt/cache/Downloads/Movie.x264-Group and place it in the same directory.  After it will delete the RAR riles.
It will not extract files in mnt/cache/Downloads/Movie.x264-Group/subs for example.

This needs to connect to an excrypted FTP server.  ie. Explicit FTP over TLS.
